    <p class="strapline">Basic concepts and rules to help guide us to making the correct choices.</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="pb-3"><strong class="text-primary d-block">Relative units:</strong> Keeping units relative means they can react and respond to their environment making them more flexibile and durable.</li>
      <li class="pb-3"><strong class="text-primary d-block">Variables and components:</strong> Reduce the amount of repetition and improve maintainability by using variables whenever something is used more than once. </li>
      <li class="pb-3"><strong class="text-primary d-block">'Mobile' first:</strong> Design and build with the smallest standard viewport in mind first then introduce complexity to larger viewports.</li>
      <li class="pb-3"><strong class="text-primary d-block">HTML first:</strong> Use standard functionality that comes free with modern web browsers and only use JavaScript to progressively enhance.</li>
      <li class="pb-3"><strong class="text-primary d-block">Accessible for all:</strong> Make sure that we do <strong>not</strong> prevent anybody from getting the most out of our systems and sites. Use tools like <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" title="WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool">WAVE</a> and automation testing to evaluate accessibility regularly.</li>
      <li class="pb-3"><strong class="text-primary d-block">Server friendly:</strong> Limit the number of calls to the serer of your application. Concatenate files where appropriate, only make ajax calls that would produce new valid information and lazy load assets.</li>
    </ul>
