    <ul>
      <li class="pb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary d-block">Relative units:</strong> Keeping units relative means they can react and
        respond to their environment making them more flexibile and durable.
      </li>
      <li class="pb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary d-block">Variables and components:</strong> Reduce the amount of repetition and
        improve maintainability by using variables whenever something is used more than once.
      </li>
      <li class="pb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary d-block">'Mobile' first:</strong> Design and build with the smallest standard
        viewport in mind first then introduce complexity to larger viewports.
      </li>
      <li class="pb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary d-block">HTML first:</strong> Use standard functionality that comes free with modern
        web browsers and only use JavaScript to progressively enhance.
      </li>
      <li class="pb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary d-block">Accessible for all:</strong> Make sure that we do
        <strong>not</strong> prevent anybody from getting the most out of our systems and sites. Use tools like
        <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/" title="WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool">WAVE</a>
        and automation testing to evaluate accessibility regularly.
      </li>
      <li class="pb-3">
        <strong class="text-primary d-block">Server friendly:</strong> Limit the number of calls to the serer of your
        application. Concatenate files where appropriate, only make ajax calls that would produce new valid information
        and lazy load assets.
