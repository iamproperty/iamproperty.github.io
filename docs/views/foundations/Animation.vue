      <h1>Animation (Beta)</h1>
      <p class="strapline">Animations come in many shapes and forms.</p>
      <p>
        They can be as subtle as a slight motion of a button, or they can appear as spectacular as a fully animated
        background. Animation can be set up as interactive reactions to your visitors’ behavior (like objects being
        revealed when scrolling), or can be independent of visitors’ actions altogether.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3"><strong>Key principles:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Foreground animations should only be triggered after user input like clicking or scrolling the page.</li>
        <li>
          Backround animations should not take focus away from the foreground or degrade its readability/usability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Loading animations should only be triggered once, if they are scroll based they should only be triggered when
          scrolling down and not up.
        </li>
        <li>
          Non-JavaScript solutions need to be considered to prevent content being hidden when an error occurs or
          JavaScript is disabled.
        </li>
        <li>Animations should be disabled or reduced significantly when a user has set reduced motion options.</li>
      </ul>
