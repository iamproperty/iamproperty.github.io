      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        Dialogs serve the purpose of unveiling critical information, displaying information while maintaining context,
        or prompting a user response when necessary.
      </p>
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>
        Dialogs are most effective when utilized for brief tasks or to notify users of task-related information. They
        offer a useful alternative to navigating users to a new page for simple tasks or gathering knowledge, as they
        are less disorienting. However, it is important to exercise caution in their usage due to their disruptive and
        potentially distracting nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dialogs should be employed sparingly. When triggered by a user's action, a dialog emerges on top of the main
        page content and remains visible until dismissed. The purpose of a dialog should be immediately apparent to the
        user, providing a clear and unmistakable path towards completion.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Types</h2>
      <p>There are two types of dialogs, modal and non-modal.</p>
      <p>
        Modal: A modal dialog initiates a state or mode that directs the user's attention solely towards a specific task
        or relevant information. While a modal dialog is active, the underlying page content is hidden and inaccessible
        until the user either completes the task or dismisses the modal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-modal: When a non-modal dialog is active, users can simultaneously view and interact with the main page
        while the dialog remains open. Non-modal dialogs are often employed to present non-critical information or offer
        optional user tasks.
      </p>

                Modal dialogs concentrate the user's attention solely on a specific task or information, obscuring
                on-page content while the modal dialog is active.

      <h2>Modal</h2>
      <p class="lead">
        A modal dialog pops up on top of a page after some user action or system trigger. It waits for user input. The
        page content below is disabled. Often, it is darkened.
      </p>

              <td>
                <strong>User response required</strong>: Utilize a dialog to prompt the user for information necessary
                to proceed with a user-initiated process that is currently being blocked.
              </td>
              <td>
                <strong>Avoid full-page modals</strong>: If a modal dialog requires more space than the large modal
                component allows, it’s recommended to display the content on a dedicated page rather than within a
                modal. Modals are not intended to substitute for a full page.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <strong>Notify urgent information</strong>: Employ a modal dialog to urgently communicate important
                information regarding the user’s ongoing work. This is commonly used to report system errors or convey
                the consequences of a user’s action.
              </td>
              <td>
                <strong>Avoid nested modals</strong>: Never trigger another modal within a modal. If the first modal
                task is dependent on a confirmation modal for approval, it’s best to perform the initial task outside of
                a modal.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>
                <strong>Confirm user decision</strong>: Implement a modal dialog to obtain confirmation for user
                decisions. Clearly describe the action being confirmed and provide an explanation of any potential
                consequences it may entail. Ensure that both the dialog’s title and button accurately reflect the action
                that will take place.
              </td>
              <td>
                <strong>Modal limits main page access</strong>: Avoid using modals when additional information outside
                of the modal is required. While a modal dialog is active, users cannot interact with the main page and
                are restricted to the information presented within the modal for decision-making. Modal tasks should be
                designed to be easily completed with the limited information provided in the dialog itself. If users
                need access to supplementary information, consider utilizing a full page instead.
