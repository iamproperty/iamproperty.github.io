  <h3>System notification usage examples</h3>
  <p>
    When deciding which component to use for system notifications, consider the urgency, importance, and persistence of
    the information or action. Toasts for non-critical and transient notifications, inline notifications and banners for
    persistent and important information and modals are best suited for critical and immediate actions.
