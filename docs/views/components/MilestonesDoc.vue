      A component for displaying nested hierarchical information to give end users visibility of key progression milestones in a linear path.

    <div class="visualtest container">
      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p class="md-col-end-7">
        A milestone is made up of nested tasks with further nested sub-tasks. The tasks and sub-tasks have a parent-child relationship where children (sub-tasks) can be toggled into view by expanding or collapsing their parent item (tasks) .

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Main elements</h3>
      <p>You should be able to label your milestone title, task title and sub-task titles. When naming, consider the end user comprehension and using descriptive summaries to provide further context where needed. Follow the below guidelines:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Milestone titles: Clear, concise naming that describes the general point in the process the end user is at.</li>
        <li>Task and sub-task titles: More specific naming relevant to the task being performed.</li>
        <li>Summaries: Provides further context to end users, brief and descriptive about things like roles, responsibilities and makes use of inviting language (marketing influence).</li>
        <li>Timestamps: The timestamps date when a sub-task was completed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Milestone</h4>

      <div class="col-end-6">
        <span class="label">Upcoming</span>
        <p>A projected step based on current progress. Displays the expected next milestone to help users anticipate what's ahead. This step may adapt based on previous actions, with a default path that can switch to alternatives as needed.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-start-7">
        <span class="label">Current step</span>
        <p>The step the user is actively progressing through. Shows the current milestone with nested tasks, which may be in progress or partially completed. Supports detailed tracking within a single stage.</p>
      </div>

       <div class="col-end-6">
        <span class="label">Completed</span>
        <p>A finished step, fully completed. Indicates that all tasks within this step are done. Helps users see their progress in a clear, linear flow.</p>
      </div>

      <h4>Tasks</h4>

      <div class="col-end-6">
        <span class="label">Projected</span>
        <p>Upcoming task with no progress started. Displays as inactive with a count of (0/x) subtasks and an unchecked progress icon to help users anticipate what's coming.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="col-start-7">
        <span class="label">In Progress</span>
        <p>Active task. Shows real-time progress with a dynamic count (e.g. 2/3) and an unchecked progress icon. Gives users clear visibility into what's underway but not yet complete.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-end-6">
        <span class="label">Completed</span>
        <p>Fully completed task. Marked with a green checked progress icon and a full subtask count (e.g. 3/3), clearly indicating that the task is finished. </p>
      </div>

      <h4>Subtasks</h4>

      <div class="col-end-6">
          <span class="label">Incomplete</span>
          <p>Subtask not yet completed. Displays an unchecked icon alongside a clear, descriptive title that outlines the work to be done. Provides transparency into the actions required to progress the overall task.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="col-start-7">
        <span class="label">Complete</span>
        <p>Subtask fully completed. Marked with a green checked icon, a persistent descriptive title, and a timestamp indicating the date of completionâ€”helping users understand both progress and the full historical timeline.</p>
      </div>

      <h3>Interactions</h3>

      <p>The milestone component is designed with minimal interactivity in its first iteration, supporting its role in presenting a clear, linear timeline of a transaction. Each milestone displays a structured hierarchy of tasks and sub-tasks, where users can toggle visibility of sub-tasks by expanding or collapsing their parent task. This approach maintains a clean layout while still providing access to detailed progression insights.</p>

      <div class="col-end-6">
        <span class="label">Collapsed</span>
        <p>Hides nested content to keep the view clean and compact.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="col-start-7">
        <span class="label">Expanded</span>
        <p>Reveals nested tasks and sub-tasks for deeper visibility.</p>
      </div>

    </div>

    <div class="visualtest container mt-4">
      <h2>Milestone Group</h2>

      <p class="md-col-end-7">
        A series of milestone components can be added to a Milestone Group component. This adds the ability to hide and show any items after the current milestone.
